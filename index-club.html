                        <dt>Burpee</dt>
                        <dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance.
                            Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat, and extend your hands forward,
                            kick your feet back, and then forward again quickly. Then jump up from a squat position.
                        </dd>
                        <dt> Plank </dt>
                        <dd> Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up position, then
                            rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                        <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push-up
                            position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can.
